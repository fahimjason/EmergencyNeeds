In our solution most important services are free such as fire service, medical, police etc. 
But another option where customer will set the maximum price youâ€™re willing to pay for a given need and then then Emergency Needs matches them with a service provider who willing to accept their price. 
This can be implemented with AWS free tire by using Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, and DynamoDB.
Our charge will add with that.
We will use AWS Machine Learning  services to track and measure results.
